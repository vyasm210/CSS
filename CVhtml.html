			I am a self-motivated, enthusiastic and creative individual who has a desire to develop new skills. My time at university when asked to take on a project has taught me the importance of communication that is needed with the client when conducting a project, this has allowed me to develop my listening skills and therefore gather the relevant information needed from the client in order to meet the objectives. The experience I have managed to gain from my time in the retail environment and as an assistant cricket coach has allowed my confidence to grow developing certain aspects of my soft skills. I am also in the process of applying my existing skills into helping a new catering company develop this is by covering all the necessary requirements the company desires.
